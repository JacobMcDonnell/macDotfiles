			<p><a href="https://git.jacobmcdonnell.com/jars/">JARS</a> is my linux auto ricing script for arch linux. It's not that good but it works most of the time, and I don't do many fresh installs anyway.</p>

			<h2><a name="about">About</a></h2>
			<p>I'm Jacob McDonnell. I have been interested in computers since I was young. My father has been in the technology field since before I was born, so I guess that interest came from him. <br><br> My interests, with respect to computers, are programming, UNIX/Plan9, and electronics/hardware. I know how to program in Java thanks to a high school course, however I am not a fan of it. Currently I am learning C, specifically Plan9 C. I hope to write my own operating system one day because I have not found an operating system that has pleased me yet. In my free time I like to play basketball, row, practice German, and play guitar. <br><br> I do not know what I will do with this website just yet. I do plan on hosting my own git server soon, maybe I will write articles about projects that I am working on.</p>
