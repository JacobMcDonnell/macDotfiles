# macOS dotfiles

Muh *macOS* Dotfiles

- ```~/.local/bin``` are my custom scripts

- Config files for:
	- Korn Shell

	- zsh

	- NeoVim

## .profile

.profile moves many files out of the home folder into sub folders

## The main Repo is on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Jacob_McDonnell/macdotfiles) but it is mirrored to [Github](https://github.com/JacobMcDonnell/macdotfiles)
